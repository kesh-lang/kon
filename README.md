> **kesh** [tree structured](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) file format â€“ suitable for configuration files

**sode** is the kesh word for _tree_ or _tree structure_.

A **sode** document is simply a [na](https://github.com/kesh-lang/na) _record_, of which every top-level identifier is a field.

Here is [TOML's example](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/1.0.0#example) written in **sode**:

```lua
